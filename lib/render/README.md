# Render: Go Graphics Library

Render is a graphics library written in Go which targets desktop applications on
Windows, MacOS and Linux as well as WebAssembly to run in the browser.

For desktop systems it uses SDL2 under the hood, and in WebAssembly it interacts
with an HTML Canvas element for drawing.
